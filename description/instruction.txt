In this project, you are given a database of transforming robots.

Each robot has 4 attributes: eye color, alternate mode, special skill, and faction.
The eye color may be red, blue, or yellow.
The alternate mode may be truck, car, jet, or animal.
The special skill may be repair, scout, supply, or attack.
The faction may be good or evil.

Implement a program using Naive Bayes classifier to predict the faction of the robots.
You may only use C/C++ programming language to implement the program. You should not use any third party libraries.

The training data and test data are provided. In the data, each line is a record, and the attributes are separated by "," comma.
After you complete the program, please write a report. The report should include the followings:
(1) The contribution of each member in your group.
(2) Brief summary of how you implemented the program.
(3) The error rate of the test data.

The due date of the project is the Monday of the final week. Please put your source code and report in a single zip file and upload it to the submission folder.
