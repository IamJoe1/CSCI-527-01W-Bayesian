Uses a generic vector of features, making it flexible and scalable.

Implements Laplace smoothing manually per feature.

Calculates log-probabilities for stability.

Uses a set of labels to avoid hardcoding class names.

Includes train/test split evaluation with varying ratios.

Separates data parsing from model logic.

More modular and extensible than other implementations.
